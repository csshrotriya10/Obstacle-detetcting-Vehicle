# Obstacle-detetcting-Vehicle
A vehicle that has an intelligence built in it such that it directs itself whenever an obstacle comes in its path. So, to protect the robot from any physical damages. This can be design to build an obstacle avoidance robotic vehicle using ultrasonic sensors for its movement. A micro-controller  is used to achieve the desired operation. An ultrasonic sensor is used to detect any obstacle ahead of it and sends a command to the micro-controller. Depending on the input signal received, the micro-controller redirects the robot to move in an alternate direction by actuating the motors which are interfaced to it through a motor driver. 

##**Components Used are:

1.Arduino Uno
2.Ultrosonic sensor
3.Motor Driver
4.Servo Motors
5.Rechargeable Battery
6.Gear Motor
7.wheel set
